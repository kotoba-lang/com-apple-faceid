  "The Face ID capability — an injected host protocol.

  `IFaceID` is the seam: a real implementation would bridge to Apple's
  `LocalAuthentication` framework (`LAContext.evaluatePolicy` with
  `.deviceOwnerAuthenticationWithBiometrics`, distinguished by
  `LABiometryType.faceID`), which cannot run inside pure `.cljc`/JVM/
  babashka — there is no portable 'real' implementation to ship here,
  only the protocol and a deterministic mock. A host (an iOS/macOS app
  shell, a React Native bridge, whatever calls into Apple's frameworks)
  supplies the real `IFaceID`; this repo lets the rest of a kotoba-lang
  auth flow depend on the shape of that capability without depending on
  Apple's SDK at all.

  Sibling of `kotoba-lang/com-apple-touchid` — same shape, distinct
  `LABiometryType`."
